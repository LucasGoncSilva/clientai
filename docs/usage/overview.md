## Getting Started

To make the most of these guides, we recommend familiarizing yourself with basic Python programming and asynchronous programming concepts, as ClientAI leverages these extensively.

### Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example to get you started with ClientAI:

```python
from clientai import ClientAI

# Initialize the client
client = ClientAI('openai', api_key="your-openai-api-key")

# Generate text
response = client.generate_text(
    "Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms.",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
)

print(response)
```

For more detailed examples and explanations, refer to the specific guides linked above.

## Advanced Usage

### Streaming Responses

ClientAI supports streaming responses for compatible providers. Here's a basic example:

```python
for chunk in client.generate_text(
    "Tell me a long story about space exploration",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    stream=True
):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

### Using Different Models

ClientAI allows you to specify different models for each provider. For example:

```python
# Using GPT-4 with OpenAI
openai_response = openai_client.generate_text(
    "Explain quantum computing",
    model="gpt-4"
)

# Using Llama 2 with Replicate
replicate_response = replicate_client.generate_text(
    "Describe the process of photosynthesis",
    model="meta/llama-2-70b-chat:latest"
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**: Always store your API keys securely, preferably as environment variables.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to manage potential API failures or rate limiting issues.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models based on your task requirements and budget considerations.
4. **Context Management**: For chat applications, manage conversation context efficiently to get the best results.
